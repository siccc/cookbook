## Future features

Here are some features I am planning to add in the near future

- **Email registration**: For demo purposes, registration is not needed currently. However, to enable synchronization between devices in the future, I plan to introduce email registration.
- **Tag filtering**: Although search by categories is already functioning, adding the ability to filter recipes based on tags would ease finding recipes.
- **Search recipes by vegetables/fruits**: I'd like to implement a search feature that enables users to find recipes based on seasonal food suggestions.
- **Shopping list consolidation**: To make grocery shopping easier, when adding ingredients from recipes, I intend to consolidate duplicate ingredients and sum the amounts.
- **Screen lock prevention**: It can be frustrating when mobile device screen turns off while cooking, so I want to introduce a feature that prevents that.
- **Customize seasonal food display language settings**: Users will be able to customize the language settings for seasonal food displays.
- **Toast messages**: I want to add a feature that displays a toast message whenever an action is successful.
- **Adding friends + recipe sharing**: I plan to expand the app for my friends and family. As a result, users will be able to add friends and share recipes with them.
- **Advanced search**: I plan to introduce an advanced search feature that uses Algolia to provide highly accurate and relevant search results.
- **Hungarian language support**: I aim to add support for the Hungarian language.
