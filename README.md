## :soon: Future features

Here are some features I am planning to add in the near future

- Email registration: For demo purposes, registration is not needed currently. However, to enable synchronization between devices in the future, I plan to introduce email registration.
- Tag filtering: Although search by categories is already functioning, adding the ability to filter recipes based on tags would ease finding recipes.
- Search recipes by vegetables/fruits: I'd like to implement a search feature that enables users to find recipes based on seasonal food suggestions.
- Shopping list consolidation: To make grocery shopping easier, when adding ingredients from recipes, I intend to consolidate duplicate ingredients and sum the amounts.
- Screen lock prevention: It can be frustrating when mobile device screen turns off while cooking, so I want to introduce a feature that prevents that.
- Toast messages: I want to add a feature that displays a toast message whenever an action is successful.
- Adding friends + recipe sharing: I plan to expand the app for my friends and family. I know we get to the point very quicky when we want to share our recipes.
- Advanced search: I plan to introduce an advanced search feature that uses Algolia to improve the currently limited free text search.
- Hungarian language support
